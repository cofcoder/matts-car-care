# Matts Car Care

> Automotive detailing in Toowoomba

I am currently building this site for the client using Nuxt.js & Vue.js. The ultimate goal is to ensure the site is **crazy fast**, **PWA enabled**, all assets and code would be available offline for the users to enjoy a fast browsing experience.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
